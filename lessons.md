    For String or any mapping datatype there are two ways of storing, one on the block chain using the 
    keyword 'Storage' and one as temp during the function call 'memory' 

    // memory -> temp storage for the duration of the function

    // storage -> stored on Etherum block chain, when you want it to be part of the contracts state

    contract state refers to the data that is stored within the contract itself.
    This data can include variables, mappings, arrays, and structs that hold information relevant to the contract's functionality.
